# Process Scheduling
**A program for CSCI 51.01 Project 1. Deadline of this is at 4 April 2022.**

C++ program that uses algorithms to schedule "processes". This program emulates how a uniprocessor would schedule processes with zero overhead (context switching is instantaneous)

Scheduling Algorithms in Code:

- First Come First Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Priority Scheduling (P)
- Round-Robin (RR)
