# Process Scheduling
**A program for a project requirement for CSCI 51.01 SY2021-2022 2nd-Sem. Deadline of this is at 6 April 2022.**

### Important Note
Run program on a CLI using this (for Windows) command:
`Project1_Grp2_code.exe < Project1_Grp2_Input.txt`

C++ program that uses algorithms to schedule "processes". This program emulates how a uniprocessor would schedule processes with zero overhead (context switching is instantaneous).

Scheduling Algorithms in Code:

- First Come First Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Priority Scheduling (P)
- Round-Robin (RR)

In the "Project1_Grp2_Input.txt" file, the odd numbered test cases were obtained from the spec sheet (Sample 1, and Sample 2 for RR only). Even numbered test cases were created by me.
