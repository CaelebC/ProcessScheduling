To run the program, compile the file "Project_Grp2_code.cpp" and run the following command on your CLI (tested on Windows):
Project1_Grp2_code.exe < Project1_Grp2_Input.txt

C++ program that uses algorithms to schedule "processes". This program emulates how a uniprocessor 
would schedule processes with zero overhead (context switching is instantaneous).

Scheduling Algorithms in Code:

- First Come First Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Priority Scheduling (P)
- Round-Robin (RR)

In the "Project1_Grp2_Input.txt" file, the odd numbered inputs were obtained from the spec 
sheet (Sample 1, and Sample 2 for RR only). Even numbered inputs were created by me.
